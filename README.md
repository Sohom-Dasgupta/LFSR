# Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)

A Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. LFSRs are widely used in various applications such as pseudo-random number generation, cryptography, and digital communications.

## Introduction

An LFSR is a shift register where the input bit is determined by a linear function of its previous state. The most commonly used linear function of single bits is the exclusive-or (XOR) operation. 

## How LFSR Works

LFSR consists of a series of flip-flops connected in series, with the output of one flip-flop connected to the input of the next. The feedback is typically taken from multiple points in the register and combined using XOR operations to produce the new input bit.

### Example
Suppose we are initializing two 4-degree LFSR having characteristics polynomial f(x) = x4 + x3 +1 and f(x) = x4 + x2 + 1, with 1000.

The sequence generated by the LFSR with characteristics polynomial f(x) = x4 + x3 +1 repeats itself after 15 sequences, thus has a period of 24 – 1 = 15. But the sequence generated by the LFSR with characteristics polynomial f(x) = x4 + x2 +1 repeats itself after 6 sequences.

If the sequence generated by the LFSR has a period 2N – 1, where N = number of flops in LFSR (or degree of the LFSR), then the LFSR is called maximum-length sequence or m-sequence.

Now the characteristic polynomial of the m-sequence LFSR is called primitive polynomial.

## Uses
The basic mechanism of LBIST is it uses a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to generate the inputs to the device’s internal scan chain, initiate a functional cycle to capture the response of the device, and then compress the captured response using a multiple input signature register (MISR).It requires a Test Pattern Generator(TPG) to generate the test patterns required to sensitize the faults and propagate the effect to the outputs (of the CUT).  Typically a Standard form LFSR is used for generating pseudo random patterns which acts as the input test vector. Each flop in the LFSR feeds a scan chain as shown in the Figure 2. In pseudo random patterns, the patterns are repeated after certain interval of time, which is why we use the term ‘pseudo’.
